# Predicting-Hospital-Readmission-for-Diabetes-Patients
Submission for Cornell Data Science Machine Learning Final Project

Diabetes healthcare expenses can be an intense financial burden for individuals and their families. Predictive modeling can help identify patients who are at risk of being readmitted. In this project, we will be testing machine learning models that can predict a patient's readmission into a hospital based on a considerable amount of categories, and assess the categories that will provide the most risk for readmission.

We obtain our data from **Diabete 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008 and https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/ which contains information on individuals with diabetes and their hospitalization and readmission records.
